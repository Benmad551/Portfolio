        <p id="about-me">Hi, I'm Benjamin Madison. I've always been drawn to helping people solve tech problems
        â€” whether fixing a teacher's computer at school or troubleshooting hardware at work. This 
        sparked my interest in IT, especially IT support, and I'm excited to keep learning and 
        discovering which areas of IT I'm most passionate about.</p>

        <div class="chatbot-rect">
            <h3>Simple Chatbot: </h3>
            <p>A simple chatbot based on the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) library. In it I primarily learned about 
                using multiple files, each with their own chatbot, then having a main file to call each of them.
                It used their structure of the chatbot, but I added my own responses depending on user input.

        <div class="website-rect">
            <h3>This Website: </h3>
            <p>A portfolio website built using HTML and CSS to showcase my projects and skills. In this project I
                learned more about HTML and CSS. I took a class where we learned about it, but I went out and started my 
                own website to practice and learn more. In this I started using transforming attributes, which is something
                I had not used before.

<h2>IT Support Stories</h2>
<p>Here are some of my personal stories relating to tech and my IT support:</p>
<div class="rect-container">
    <div class="UPS-rect">
        <h3>The beeping UPS</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> The UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) for the register system in a retail store was beeping continuously. The register system was still operational, but the beeping was distracting for both employees and customers. <br>
            <strong>What I did:</strong> I first looked at the UPS itself to see if there was something that looked off. After looking at that, it looked like there was no power going into the UPS so I checked the plug and saw that it was starting to fall out of the socket. After pushing it in, the beeping stopped. <br>
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Start troubleshooting with the small things first.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PC-rect">
        <h3>Locked PC</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Help needed setting up a used PC that was locked in the previous owner's account. <br>
            <strong>What I did:</strong> I researched tutorials online for account recovery, and after going through different methods, I ended up resetting the PC to factory settings for the user to use a new account. <br>
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Sometimes you need to stop and take the simple route. I wanted to recover the old account, but it was easier to reset the PC.
