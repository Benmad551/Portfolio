# Portfolio
This is a project website to host important information for job applications.

It will include links to my email, important social medias (GitHub | LinkedIn), and links to other projects

To Do:

 - Add more content to the website so that the sections are not so close to eachother

 - Create SVGs for contact Icons

 - Look at example Portfolio websites to get ideas

 - Look at ways to incoperate JavaScript

 - add more animations to the website once more content is added
